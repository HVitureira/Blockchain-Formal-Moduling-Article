  abstract = {The blockchain technology is creating a great impact on the stakeholders of different departments. It resolves data security and centralized database issues. In this work, blockchain-based smart market system is presented to ensure quality of products and to increase tax ratio. In smart market system, we have defined customer, distributors, stores and distributor departments as operation in VDM-SL in which their details are managed and stored in blockchain. Furthermore, product sale, purchase and quality details are saved as transactions in the blockchain. All the details are viewed by relevant departments such as quality assurance authority, distribution departments, distributors and customers using mobile application, which are also described as operations in the system specification. Due to lack of space, we have not mentioned customer and distributor departments in detail. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to describe blockchain-based smart market diagrammatically. We have automated our model using Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to realize behavior of the system. Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL) is used to formally describe and analyze the system properties and invariants. VDM-SL toolbox is used to ensure system correctness and efficiency before implementation phase.},

  abstract = {As a decentralized and distributed secure storage technology, the notion of blockchain is now widely used for electronic trading in finance, for issuing digital certificates, for copyrights management, and for many other security-critical applications. With applications in so many domains with high-assurance requirements, the formalization and verification of safety and security properties of blockchain becomes essential, and the aim of the present paper. We present the model-based formalization, simulation and verification of a blockchain protocol by using the SDL formalism of Telelogic Tau. We consider the hierarchical and modular SDL model of the blockchain protocol and exercise a methodology to formally simulate and verify it. This way, we show how to effectively increase the security and safety of blockchain in order to meet high assurance requirements demanded by its application domains. Our work also provides effective support for assessing different network consensus algorithms, which are key components in blockchain protocols, as well as on the topology of blockchain networks. In conclusion, our approach contributes to setting up a verification methodology for future blockchain standards in digital trading.},

@article{Kawahara2020,
  abstract = {This paper proposes a formal approach for verifying a customizable consensus rule used in a blockchain protocol. Hyperledger Fabric supports an application-specific, customizable consensus rule called endorsement policy to support diverse blockchain applications. However, this makes it difficult to ensure the properties such as Byzantine fault tolerance.The proposed method has the following features: (i) A dedicated model format is defined to enable a user to concisely describe the requirements characteristic to a blockchain network. (ii) The number of states of a model is reduced by (ii-a) eliminating the behavior of the platform from the model, (ii-b) describing the state space constraints in linear arithmetic, and (ii-c) applying an SMT (satisfiability modulo theory) solver. This paper demonstrates that the method supports the modeling of a collusion by nodes governed by a same organization, which is a typical threat when participating organizations do not trust each other. Also, the verification time is measured to find that the method is scalable to approximately 100 nodes.},

@article{Liu2019,
  abstract  = {A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate and enforce the negotiation of a contract in undependable environment. However, the number of attacks using the vulnerabilities of the smart contracts is also growing in recent years. Many solutions have been proposed in order to deal with them, such as documenting vulnerabilities or setting the security strategies. Among them, the most influential progress is made by the formal verification method. In this paper, we propose a formal verification method based on Colored Petri Nets (CPN) to verify smart contracts in blockchain system. First, we develop the smart contract models with possible attacker models based on hierarchical CPN modeling, then the smart contract models are executed by step-by-step simulation to validate their functional correctness, and finally we utilize the branch timing logic ASK-CTL based model checking technology in the CPN tools to detect latent vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We demonstrate that our CPN modeling based verification method can not only detect the logical vulnerabilities of the smart contract, but also consider the impacts of users behavior to find out potential non-logical vulnerabilities in the contracts, such as the vulnerabilities caused by the limitations of the Solidity language.},

@article{Murray2019,
  abstract  = {Due to the immutable nature of distributed ledger technology such as blockchain, it is of utter importance that a smart contract works as intended before employment outside test network. This is since any bugs or errors will become permanent once published to the live network, and could lead to substantial economic losses; as manifested in the infamous DAO smart contract exploit hack in 2016. In order to avoid this, formal verification methods can be used to ensure that the contract behaves according to given specifications. This paper presents a survey of the state of the art of formal verification of smart contracts. Being a relatively new research area, a standard or best practice for formal verification of smart contracts has not yet been established. Thus, several different methods and approaches have been used to perform the formal verification. The survey presented in this paper shows that some variant of model checking or theorem proving methodology seems to be most successful. However, as of today, formal verification is only successful on simple contracts, and does not support more advanced smart contract syntax.},
